# Creating shopping cart with React and strapi as the backend API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tech Stack

- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as backend API and CMS for CURD products.
- Client side fetch done by [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/).This library is very robust and declarative way to fetch data in react apps
- [Chakra Ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) for design and styling
